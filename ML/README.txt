This code is written in Python 3 and requires the following libraries to be installed:

numpy
pandas
sklearn
The purpose of this code is to build a predictive model for the Titanic dataset, available in the "../input/titanic/" directory. The model is a Random Forest Classifier and it is trained on the "train.csv" file. The predicted results are saved in a file called "submission.csv" in the same directory.

To run the code, simply execute the script in a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed. When run, the script will output the following information to the console:

The first few rows of the "train.csv" file
The first few rows of the "test.csv" file
The percentage of women who survived the Titanic disaster
The percentage of men who survived the Titanic disaster
A message indicating that the submission file was successfully saved
Note that the path to the input and output files are relative paths, so the directory structure should be preserved.
